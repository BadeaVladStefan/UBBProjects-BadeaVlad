Toy Language Interpreter

The Toy Language Interpreter is a Java-based project aimed at interpreting a simple programming language. It features a user-friendly JavaFX GUI for interaction, allowing users to input code snippets and visualize the execution process step by step. The interpreter supports various expressions and statements with different data types, and it implements essential Abstract Data Types (ADTs) such as Execution Stack, Heap, Symbol Table, and Output List to facilitate interpretation. This project showcases proficiency in Java programming, GUI development, and data structures, while also providing insights into language interpretation and execution.
